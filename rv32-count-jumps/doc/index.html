<html><head></head><body><p>Write a RISC-V function with the following prototype:</p>

<pre><code>int count_jumps(int *array, int size)
</code></pre>

<p><code>array</code> is the address of an array of 32-bit integers, and <code>size</code> is
the number of entries in the array (so the total memory used by the
array is <code>4 × size</code>), and all <code>int</code> values mean 32-bit integers.</p>

<p>The function should do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Start at the last element in the array (it will have at least
one element)</p></li>

<li><p>Load the element from the array and add it to the current index</p></li>

<li><p>If the index is outside the bounds of the array, stop</p></li>

<li><p>Return the total number of array indices visited</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For example, if you were given the array with these 5 numbers:</p>

<pre><code>0, 0, 1, 2, -2
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You would start with index 4 (the last valid index in the
array).</li>
<li>You would load the value -2 from the array, and adding that to
the index would give a new index of 2.</li>
<li>The element with index 2 is 1, so you would add that to the
index, yielding 3.</li>
<li>The element at index 3 is 2, so you would add 2 to the index and
get 5.</li>
<li>Index 5 is past the end of the array, so you would stop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you loaded a total of 3 values (-2, 1, and 2), you would
return 3.</p>

<p>Note that you should stop when the index is off either end of the
array.</p>

<p>Write your code in the file <code>count_jumps.s</code>.</p>
